# Research Community Outreach with Open Science Team Agreement

# About this Lesson

In 2022 the librarian-led Bay Area Open Science Group created the Open Science Team Agreement template. The template gives researchers and other stakeholders a practical tool to understand and advocate for open science practices at a broader scale within their laboratory, department, or community. The Open Science Team Agreement is also an adaptable tool for librarians who would like to engage in open science and be able to approach research groups with a concrete resource that can serve as a starting point for conversations about library support for these practices. This lesson will introduce the Open Science Team Agreements and help librarians plan a research outreach activity for their audience using the agreements.
