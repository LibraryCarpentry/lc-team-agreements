:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you access and edit the team agreements?
- How do you use it for an example domain?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Download the Team Agreements from Zenodo
- Locate an appropriate subject data repository for the research group
- Edit the Team Agreements

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Accessing the Open Science Team Agreement

The Open Science Team Agreements are available from Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/record/7154100. On this page you will find versions for Word, Google Doc, Overleaf, and plain text. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Exploring the Agreement - Group Discussion or Think-Pair-Share

Go to Zenodo and download a copy of the Open Science Team Agreement on the platform of your choice. Skim the content of the agreements. Which of these are topics that you regularly discuss with researchers and which ones are new to you? Jot down a couple of notes and we will discuss as a group.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Customizing the Team Agreement
Let’s practice customizing the Open Science Team agreements for an example team.

### Case Study - Dr. Sheri Lee (Fictional) 

Sheri Lee is a clinical researcher at UC San Francisco working on the link between lung cancer and pollution. She collects clinical data from the EHR and also gathers data via patient questionnaires. Her team consists of herself, one clinical research coordinator, and two graduate students and she is committed to giving credit to their work. She tries to share her preprints on MedRxiv, and her data in the Vivli clinical repository. She doesn’t currently share her postprints, or routinely share slides or her code.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: Customizing the Agreement for for Dr. Lee

You are meeting with Dr. Lee this week to talk about Open Science practices. Make two edits to the Open Science Team Agreement based on what you currently know about Dr. Lee’s workflow to customize it for this team. What is one suggestion you have for a new practice they might try?

Share the edits you made with the class and provide your rationale.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Possible edits to the Open Science Team Agreement based on current practices include: 

- Adding MedRxiv to the preprints section
- Familiarizing team members with CREDIT system to formalize author contributions
-  Designating Vivli as their data repository 

Ideas for edits for new practices

 - Code in Zenodo
 - Postprints in institutional repository
 - Uploads presentation slides to the institutional repository
