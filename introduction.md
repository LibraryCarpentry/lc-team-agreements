## Introduction: What is open science?

**According to the [UNESCO Recommendations on Open Science](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949),** **Open science** combines various movements and practices aiming 

- to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly **available, accessible and reusable** for everyone,
- to increase scientific **collaborations** and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, 
- and to open the **processes** of scientific knowledge **creation, evaluation and communication** to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. 

**In practice,** open science requires cultural change at the organizational level, within lab groups, and for individuals. 

Open science offers opportunities for librarians, research data managers and [other roles] to engage in outreach and instructional activities to assist with this transition. 

## Foundation: Lab Manuals

Many researchers use lab manuals as documents that outline practices, techniques and institutional knowledge for students and researchers in a laboratory setting. They also act as a compact or agreement that makes group norms and expectations transparent.

Examine the examples below to get a sense of what is included in a lab manual.

For more lab manual examples:

- [Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)
- [Benjamin-Chung Lab Manual](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/)
- [CCT-Data Science Team Protocols](https://osf.io/tzmhp/wiki/home/)

## Open Science Team Agreement

Inspired by lab manuals, the [Bay Area Open Science group](https://bayareaopensciencegroup.github.io/) created this open science team agreement to codify a commitment to certain research practices. Intended for collaborations of any size, the Open Science team agreement allows group members to start conversations, learn about open science and commit to new open practices. Groups can return to and revise the agreement at regular intervals as needed. We recommend creating the team agreement for a new project or team.

[Figure: Team Agreement Template screenshot]

The Open Science Team Agreement template includes brief explanations of key open science topics, practices and products that group members might like to discuss, learn about and adopt including:

| Topic| Sub-topic|
|----|----|
|Authorship and collaboration | Persistent Identifiers, Author order, and Inclusive Science |
|Articles and research materials | Preregistration, Methods and Protocols, Preprints, Open Access, Theses and Dissertations, and Presentations |
|Data and code | Documentation, Data, Software and Code |
|Communication and Impact | Copyright, Research Profiles, Social Media |


Within those categories the template offers suggestions for products and services that address specific workflow needs.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

How does a Lab Manual and an Open Science Team Agreement differ?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Possible discussion prompts:
A Lab Manual is a broader, foundational document that also covers university policy, employment details, lab safety, equipment access
An Open Science Team Agreement might live within a Lab Manual
An Open Science Team Agreement is specific to open science practices and workflows
An Open Science Team Agreement might be adopted by a group of collaborators from different labs or different institutions.
