# Lesson Description
in 2022 the librarian-led Bay Area Open Science Group created the Open Science Team Agreement template. The template gives researchers and other stakeholders a practical tool to understand and advocate for open science practices at a broader scale within their laboratory, department, or community. The Open Science Team Agreement is also an adaptable tool for librarians who would like to engage in open science and be able to approach research groups with a concrete resource that can serve as a starting point for conversations about library support for these practices. This lesson will introduce the Open Science Team Agreements and help librarians plan a research outreach activity for their audience using the agreements.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners should be able to:

- Summarize three benefits of an open science team agreement
- Modify the open science team agreements for an example research group 
- Identify a local research team and reframe the open science team agreement template with them in mind
- Design an outreach plan (including an outreach email template, lesson outline, slides, assessment) for a specific research audience using the open science team agreements

# Pre-Requisites
This lesson assumes a basic familiarity with open science practices like open access, data sharing, open code, open educational resources.
