## Identify your Local Audience

Now that you have some familiarity with the Open Science Team Agreement let’s think about how you can use them with your research audience. First let’s brainstorm some potential audiences. This outreach can be at the level of a department, lab, or group.

**Departments**

What departments do you cover? 
Take a look at their departmental website and identify one or two faculty members 

- Can you tell how open their current research is?
- Do they have their own profile page, website, or GitHub repository that you can consult? 
- Consult OSF institutions, preprints or registrations to search for affiliated contributors.
- How and when does this department meet? (In person, online, etc)

**Lab groups** 

- Follow department event and seminar topics
- Search campus data and publication repositories, profile systems for possible champions/interested groups

**Open science groups**

Are there any working groups, journal clubs or other community groups that focus on open science?
Examples:

- [Bay Area Open Science Group](bayareaopensciencegroup.github.io/)
- [Reproducibilitea](https://reproducibilitea.org/)
- [Open Science Communities](https://openscience-utrecht.com/)

## Email Outreach Template

What messaging will resonate with your audience? Consider how you might adapt the following email template for your selected audience.

Hi [Faculty Meeting Organizer's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to suggest a topic for your upcoming faculty meeting: Open Science Team Agreements.

Open Science is all about making research more transparent and collaborative, which can benefit us and our students in many ways. I'd love to share some practical tips and insights on how we can adopt Open Science principles in the department. I’m promoting an Open Science Team Agreement that can help researchers make open science actionable. 

If it fits your next meeting's agenda, could we slot in a brief presentation on this topic? I think it could spark some interesting discussion.

Looking forward to your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
